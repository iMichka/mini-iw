mini-iw
=======

mini-iw (mini - ITK Wrapping) is a subset of the ITK code, adapted for testing purposes. The goal is to be able to experiment new stuff on the wrapping infrastructure (adding new languages, benchmarking). Therefore this project should remain as lightweight as possible.

The cmake project will:
- install gccxml
- install pcre
- install swig
- run the pipeline to build the python wrapping
